    <h2>the weather in kobuleti</h2>
    <p>
        As soon as you set your foot on Kobuleti land you get not only in to the terrain, inhabited by people from ancient times , but also in to the area, which has a long and very well-known resort history. Some of its features we will discuss now.
        In Georgian autonomous republic Ajaria along the Black Sea shore, at a distance of about 24 km from the city of Batumi, is spreaded resort city Kobuleti, but rather a town with a population of about 19 thousand people. This figure is very relative because the number of people here is a lot more due to the tourists. Especially crowdedis Kobuleti from May to September, when the temperature averages 28°C and the sea is fabulously warm - up to + 26 ° C.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depending on the weather the swimming season can last until mid-October. Below + 5 ° C is rare phenomenon even in winter, so in the «off-season» time a large number of people who wish to improve their health or simply relax comes here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting from October 2010 for the development of the resort was given more resources and the tourist infrastructure is improved significantly. Today you will be welcomed here by several health centers (including 2 for children), holiday centers, guest houses and hotels. A hospitable local people sincerely invite you to stay in their homes.
        After getting by plane or by sea to Batumi in about half an hour drive on the shuttle bus or a traditional taxi you arrive in a delightful Kobuleti. But sertainly the most convenient way is to pre-book a transfer from our company.
    </p>
    <h2>recreation. accommodation prices</h2>
    <p>
        The infrastructure of the city is quite developed. For your pleasure are umbrellas, deck chairs, scooters, boats, motorboats, inflatable slides and other amenities and entertainment. Very close are bars and cafes. The resort has many playgrounds and your kids will have a place where to frolic. Visiting Kobuleti, perhaps, you will be pleasantly surprised by the level of service. Accomodations are for all tastes: from a single room in a house on the shore or directly in the village to the comfortable rooms at the hotel with a view of the boundless sea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conserning accommodation, entertainment and food prices Kobuleti can not be rated as the cheapest one. For example, ten minutes of riding on a sea scooter can cost you $ 20! However, we can say that the cost of a little rest is offset by relatively cheap dining. Experienced tourists often resting on the Black Sea coast are warning that in the season (June through August) prices are rising much more!
    </p>
    <h2>attractions</h2>
    <p>
        While in Kobuleti, you can not only relax, but also to get acquainted with the south-western part of Georgia. With its landscapes, hospitable people and attractions.
