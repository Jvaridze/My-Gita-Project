    <h1>Anaklia Resort</h1>
    <p>The seaside resort of Anaklia is part of the Samegrelo region, where the earliest settlement dates back to the mid-Bronze Age. After the division of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 15th century, Anaklia was a significant fortified town, a seaport, and a fishing station of the region. When the Ottomans conquered the country, the town became a maritime port and a slave-trading location. Today, Anaklia is a peaceful resort with good hotels around the town. There’s a 552-meter “flying” bridge connecting the village Ganmukhuri with the resort. Since 2015, it has become a go-to destination for electronic music lovers, as Anaklia hosts an annual festival called GEM Fest in August.

        It is a small village in which, at first glance, here one can find everything for both the development and prosperous life – a favorable location, pleasant climate, and sea. But despite this, the people of Anaklia are struck with total unemployment and poverty. Many locals believe that the authorities lack the political will to develop Anaklia and because of this, they have to wait for the fulfillment of grandiose promises that were made more than 10 years ago.
        The Georgian authorities began to develop the resort rapidly in 2010. However, after the change of power in 2012, officials in the capital have once again forgotten about Anaklia. The hopes that were reborn in 2016, when the construction of a deep-sea port began here, never lived up to the expectations. The project, from which multimillion-dollar investments, thousands of jobs, and even a geopolitical breakthrough were expected, was stopped in 2020 due to a dispute between investors and the Georgian government. Together with the suspended project, life in Anaklia also stopped.

        The central street of Anaklia is beautiful, with palm trees growing along its entire length.
        Moving away from the center of the village and the coast, one may notice how the European Anaklia disappears and the views of an ordinary Georgian village replace it. Broken and muddy streets, old houses, rickety fences, in some places old, rusted signs of apartments for rent in Georgian and Russian appear.
        Locals speak sparsely and little. This is caution – on the other side of the scale is the fate of the summer season.

        Anaklia is a seaside resort with sandy beaches located in the Georgian region of Samegrelo, on the border with Abkhazia, just 30 kilometers from the administrative center of Zugdidi. The village is famous for the longest in Georgia 552-meter pedestrian bridge across the Inguri River, which connects Anaklia with the neighboring village of Ganmukhuri.
        In 2011, under the previous government, it was planned to grant Anaklia the status of a city. In 2012, it was announced that a new port city, Lazika, would be built in the area adjacent to Anaklia. This city was to become the second-largest in Georgia with half a million population by 2024.
        Construction began on several buildings, but the project was halted in 2012 when President Mikhail Saakashvili’s party lost the election. Since then, Georgia has been ruled by the Georgian Dream party, the party of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, which has little sympathy for the projects launched under Saakashvili.
        According to the statistics service of Georgia, in 2014, 510 families, or about 1,400 people, lived in Anaklia. The main source of income for local residents is tourism and fishing.
