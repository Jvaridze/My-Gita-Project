    <h1>Tsikhisdziri</h1>
    <p>Tsikhisdziri resort is located in Adjara, Kobuleti municipality, on the Black Sea coast, 60-90 meters above sea level. It is distinguished by the uniqueness of the climate, here the sea and mountain climate merge. Here is colder in summer than in Batumi and Kobuleti, and warmer in winter. In Tsikhisdziri you will enjoy with greenery beaches and amazing views of the endless sea. Well-appointed beaches, beautiful gardens, comfortable hotels, cafe-bars and restaurants will create an ideal environment for a wonderful and unforgettable vacation. Apart from nature and entertainment places, Tsikhisdziri is also an interesting place from the cultural-historical point of view. This area has been inhabited since ancient times and the historic fortress-town of the Kingdom of Lazica was cultivated here. The main attraction of Tsikhisdziri is Petra Fortress, which attracts a lot of tourists.

    <h2>Beach description</h2>
    <p>
        The beach itself is divided into northern and southern parts: both are covered with large and small shingle, but the second has a steeper entry. The depth near the coast is several meters, which makes the southern Tsikhisdziri attractive for diving enthusiasts. However, it is worth considering a strong, hardly noticeable current; as well as the fact that there are no loungers or any bars. But there is sea and mountain air, pierced by the smell of pines and eucalyptus trees, a small number of visitors and absolute peace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before swimming, it is worth visiting the nearby Peter Fortress: it was erected in the VI century and has an unusual shape in the form of ladder disposed terraces and corridors. Here there is the only four-star hotel closest to the beach, for guests of which it is possible to go down to the sea by a special staircase or by funicular.
    </p>

    <h2>When is the best time to go?</h2>
    <p>
        In summer, Georgia has very hot weather, which sometimes interferes with enjoying  beach vacations and excursions. Therefore, the best time to visit the Black Sea resorts falls on May, June and September.
