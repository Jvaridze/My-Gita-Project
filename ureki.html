    <h1>Ureki</h1>
    <p>It is located on the west coast of Georgia next to the village of the same name. One of the few sandy beaches of the Black Sea coastline of the country, which is also famous for its healing properties. The five-kilometer coastline is covered with unusual gray and black sand, which contains magnetite (Magnetite is the second name of the beach). It has a unique healing effect on the human body and helps with diseases of the musculoskeletal system, heart and lungs. Similar sand is found on the beaches of Costa Rica, the Philippines, and Bulgaria, but only this one is used for medicinal purposes and has a proven physiotherapy effect.
    </p>
    <h2>Beach description</h2>
    <p>Despite the fact, that the beach is wide and quite long, there is always crowded and lively. Therefore, it is better to avoid the high season and come to Ureki in June or September. .
    The central part of the beach is the most crowded, there are many people also at the water's edge. There are much fewer vacationers along the edges, so judges of peace and quiet should walk a bit along the coast in search of a secluded place.
    </p>
    <p>The beach is not equipped, there are only a few showers and toilets at the entry, so it is necessary to take care of umbrellas and other beach accessories by yourself. Do not forget about comfortable beach shoes - the sand here is very hot, viscous and deep.
    The sea is shallow, pure and warm, but because of the sandy bottom it is rarely perfectly clear. Entry into the water is gradual and comfortable, which is a definite plus for tourists of advanced age and families with small children.
    </p>
   <p> At the entry to the beach there are cafes and eateries, a playground is organized there, there are several shops and souvenir tents. All kinds of water attractions and entertainment are provided.
    A dense pine forest stretches along the coast, which creates a unique microclimate and fills the surroundings with the heady aroma of needles. In the shade of the trees there are tourists with tents and companies, that came for a picnic. Unfortunately, they do not always keep cleanliness and often leave behind domestic waste. Visitors of the beach also face the same problem, who are forced to clean by themselves a place in the sun from cigarette butts and small garbage. One more disadvantage of these places is the abundance of mosquitoes, so it is necessary to take care of repellents and other means of protection.
