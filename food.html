    <h2 id="narikala">Khinkali (Georgian Dumplings)</h2>
    <img src="https://gastronomia.ge/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/huitg.jpg">
    <p></p>
    <p>Beautifully twisted knobs of dough, khinkali are typically stuffed with meat and spices, then served boiled or steamed. The trick with khinkali is to eat them without making a mess or spilling the hot broth inside all over yourself. How to eat khinkali: sprinkle with black pepper, grab the dumpling by the handle and turn upside down. Take small bites from the side, slurping some broth as you go.
    </p>
    <p>Although traditional khinkali typically features meat, vegetarian khinkali featuring fillings of mushroom and cheese/curd are often available if you ask for them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="abanotubani">Badrijani Nigvzit</h2>
    <img src="https://cdnn1.img.sputnik-georgia.com/img/23434/89/234348948_0:65:1475:900_2072x0_60_0_0_34c2d0c45cb4d69599139b5c51cadda3.jpg">
    <p>Roasted eggplant (badrijan) strips, served flat and topped with walnut paste. Sweet and savory, this dish is one of Audrey’s favorites.
    </p>
    <h2 id="sameba">Lobio (Bean Soup)</h2>
    <img src="https://gemrielia.ge/media/images/9e64386da924bdf-4DF8BA02-8EE8-4754-8648B47D92585213-900x600.jpg">
    <p>A cross between bean soup and refried beans. The consistency and taste of lobio varies widely. That it often bears a resemblance to Mexican bean dishes is almost always satisfying. For full effect, the traditional way to eat lobio is with a round of mchadi, Georgian corn bread. We often searched for lobio after we'd been exhausted by meat and bread, and found it quite often, including in some unusual locations.
    </p>
    <h2 id="openair">Chakapuli</h2>
    <img src="https://kulinaria.ge/media/recipe-images/2017/03/sokos_chaqafuli.jpg">
    <p>Traditional herbed lamb stew from Kakheti, chakapuli is typically eaten around the holidays (e.g., Easter). Chakapuli typically features a meat like veal or lamb, and is further flavored by onions, tkemali (sour plums), white wine, garlic and mixed herbs.
    </p>
    <h2 id="metekhi">Mtsvadi</h2>
    <img src="https://gastronomia.ge/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/00-1.jpg">
    <p>Fire-roasted chunks of pork, salted. For the perfect mtsvadi, cut some fresh onions and place in a metal bowl, then stir it over a fire. We were lucky to have mtsvadi in an impromptu barbecue in the mountains. It was among some of the best barbecued meat we’ve ever had.
    </p>
    <h2 id="funicular">Satsivi</h2>
    <img src="https://ojaxi.ge/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/4-4.jpg">
    <p>Poultry (chicken or turkey) served with a thinned paste of walnut, garlic and herbs. Considered a winter dish (“sivi” implies cold in Georgian), satsivi is usually eaten around the Christmas holiday and the New Year, particularly in the region of Adjari. Though we’ve enjoyed this at Georgian restaurants abroad, we unfortunately didn’t have an authentic opportunity to try it this time around.
    </p>
    <h2>Khachapuri </h2>
    <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/556738c2e4b0ab3593aa1f30/1585535236723-JA6632ZR113SINM3RLFQ/imeruli+khachapuri">
    <p>No visit to Georgia would be complete (or possible) without a few tastes of khachapuri, the warm, gooey cheese-stuffed bread that oozes and drips with heart-stopping goodness. In addition to the standard round pie stuffed with cheese, other variations include egg-topped (Adjarian khachapuri), the four-fold filo dough pocket, and tarragon, mushroom and rice-stuffed pies.
