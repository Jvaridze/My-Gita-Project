    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
    <p>Georgia is a small mountainous country in the Caucasus region made up of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
        and Russia. About 3.7 million people live in the country, around one million of whom live in the capital, Tbilisi.</p>
    <p>Georgia’s history has long been in flux. Several kingdoms were established in the classical era in the area that is
        modern-day Georgia. Later, when these kingdoms disintegrated, several empires—including the Ottomans, Persians,
        Russians, and Mongols—vied for control of the region. In the early 20th-century, Georgia became part of the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>The country became independent in 1991, but later its territories Abkhazia and South Ossetia was occupied by Russia.
        In 2008, Georgia fought a brief war with Russia due to it increasingly looking towards Europe in the hopes
        of joining the European Union.</p>

    <h2 id="Visa">Visa for Goergia</h2>
    <p>Rejoice! Citizens of 94 countries don’t need a visa to visit Georgia. If your country is on this list, you can travel
        to the country visa-free for one year. This means you’ll get a stamp in your passport at the airport or land border
        crossing without having to fill out any visa forms or pay any money.</p>
    <p>There’s also no minimum requirement for the number of days out of the country before returning; technically
        you can leave and come back the next day to start another visa-free year. That’s one hell of a deal!</p>
    <p>If you are one of the unlucky ones who do need a visa, don’t despair. It’s relatively straightforward to
        get an e-visa. Head to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to apply. Since 2020 Georgia
        also has the ‘Remotely from Georgia’ program. This program is meant to attract digital nomads to the
        country and is great for those who don’t fall under the visa-free regime.</p>

    <h2 id="Visit-time">Best Time To Visit</h2>
    <p>The best time to visit Georgia is in spring and fall… unless you’re skiing, that is!
    In winter it gets cold and snowy. Think freezing temperatures and loads of snow in the mountains.</p>
    <p>Peak travel season is in the summer months of June – August, when everyone from beach-going Russians to trekkers of all backgrounds flock to the Caucasus country. Accommodation increases in price, and often fills up in places like Batumi. Unless you’re only off around this time, it’s better to avoid the high season. Be warned that Tbilisi can get really hot in summers, with temperatures reaching 40° C and up.</p>
    <p>The most ideal time to visit is in the shoulder seasons of spring and fall. If you can wangle a trip during April/May or September/October, do it!</p>
    <h2 id="language">Language in Georgia</h2>
    <p>Georgian is the national language, which uses the Georgian alphabet. Although the alphabet is beautiful, it’s quite difficult to read. Most visitors won’t bother with learning it, though it’s certainly worth trying! I managed to learn it from reading signs after 3 weeks of travel in Georgia.</p>
    <p>It isn’t necessary to know the alphabet to travel in Georgia, but picking up a few words of Georgian is always ideal. Some handy phrases include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hello – Gamarjoba</li>
        <li>Thank you – Madloba</li>
        <li>Yes – Ki</li>
        <li>No – Ara</li>
        <li>Excuse me – Ukatsravad</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Currency">Currency and payment in Georgia</h2>
    <p>Georgia uses the Georgian lari, abbreviated GEL. At the time of writing, 1 USD = 3.11 GEL
        There are 100 tetri in each lari. GEL come in denominations of 1 GEL (coin), 2 (coin), and 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 notes.</p>
    <p>Georgia is not a cash-only country. In cities, it’s becoming increasingly popular to pay by debit card or credit card. Services like Apple and Google Pay or also increasingly becoming popular. However, you’ll still see more people paying for things in cash, especially outside of major cities.</p>
