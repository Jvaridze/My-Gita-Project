            <p>There are many hotels in Gudauri. Most of them are very nice and comfortable. The prices are higher than usual in the period of the New Year holiday. There are many good places for eating also. Some of the restaurants are located close to the skiing tracks. It’s very convenient for skiers, but usually, there are many people and poor services.
            </p>
            <h2>Safe Skiing</h2>
            <p>Since 2016, the ski patrols have been working to secure the safety of the skiers. They are experienced and professionals. They can do first aid.
            Gudauri ski resort came into existence 30 years ago. Today, the development plan grows the popularity of the resort not only in Georgia but even beyond. Gudauri ski resort offers a lot of opportunities and different kind of activities to people.
            The main priorities of Gudauri are the close location and many types of ski tracks. Therefore, Gudauri has become one of the most visiting places at the weekends for Georgians. One day for spending the time in Gudauri is quite enough. It’s possible to start the journey at 08:00 AM, then to continue ski in Gudauri and to be back in Tbilisi at 19:00 PM.
            <p>The negative side of Gudauri is that there are many people on weekends. The skiing tracks are crowded at the weekends, and there are long queues at the cashier’s office. The prices at the hotels and in the restaurants are higher than in other ski resorts of Georgia. In a nutshell, if you have 4 - 5 days, it would be better to visit Hatsvali or Goderdzi ski resort.
