        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The GG Travel Boardâ€™s mission is to market and maintain the quality of the Georgia region
            experience for the benefit of both the visitor and the economic sustainability of the community.
            GG Travel Oraganization was formed
            in 2017 to assume the responsibility of marketing the Georgia region as a year-round destination.
            GG Travel Board is a private, not-for-profit, 501 (c) (6) with a self-appointing board.</p>
            <p>Over the years, the GG Travel Board's efforts have evolved to address tourism management
            and sustainability to ensure preservation of the community.
            Radcliffe Reports
            In 2017, the company was hired by the towns of Georgia to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Georgia and Visitors Bureau, to form
            a new destination marketing organization.</p>
            <p>GG Travel formed a plan including organizational structure, destination marketing
            observations, staffing structure, budget and plan implementation. The 2005 Radcliffe Report can be viewed here.
            returned in 2019 to initiate another review of the organization to ensure effective
            resource deployment strategies and that overall performance was properly aligned with the needs of the industry
            and the community. The 2019 Radcliffe Report can be viewed here.</p>
