<h2>Taste Georgian Wine</h2>

    <p>The secret about Georgian wine, which many locals even make in their home, is officially out. Georgian wine is quickly becoming renowned as some of the highest quality vino in all of Europe. And with good reason: the temperate environmental conditions in Georgia’s province of Kakheti, combined with centuries of experience by the local vintners, make for seriously delicious stuff. The Kakheti wine region is basically “Georgia’s Napa Valley,” and going on a vineyard tour is a must-do in Georgia. You can easily do this via a day tour from Tbilisi to Kakheti (here’s Viator’s top rated tour, and here’s Get Your Guide’s).

<h2>Visit Svaneti, a Medieval Land</h2>

    <p>One of the most enchanting places on the planet is locked high in Georgia’s Caucasian mountains. The province of Svaenti is dotted with hundreds of ancient watchtowers, which for years helped the locals keep invaders at bay. Primarily accessible only through a single long and winding road, Svaneti has recently become one of the more popular things to do in Georgia thanks in part to a small Georgia airline that runs flights from Tbilisi. Flights are usually booked up months in advance, but if you can’t snag one you can still get there from Tbilisi via this private tour.

<h2>Trek in the Caucasian Mountains</h2>

    <p>You’ll feel a bit like Marco Polo crossing the famous Silk Road when you set out for your trek through the Georgian countryside. With soaring mountain peaks, expansive farmland, and lush forests broken up by tiny but welcoming villages, Georgia is probably one of the most underrated trekking destinations in the world. One of the more popular routes is the multi-day trek from Mestia to Ushguli, though there are dozens to choose from around the country of Georgia.

   <h2>Eat Khachapuri</h2>

        I’m not much of a foodie, so if a food captures my heart you know it must be truly magical. And Khachapuri is the stuff of legends.
        This traditional Georgian cheese bread can be prepared a number of different ways, but by far my favorite is Acharuli. You’ll have to try it for yourself, but let’s just say that it involves an egg cracked over layers of doughy, cheesy goodness. Just trust me, trying khachapuri is a can’t-miss thing to do in Georgia (country)!
