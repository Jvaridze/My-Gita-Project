    <h2 id="narikala">Narikala Fortress</h2>
    <img src="https://georgiantravelguide.com/storage/files/nariqalas-tsikhesimagre-krepost-narikala.jpg">
    <p></p>
    <p>Dominating the Old Town skyline, Narikala dates right back to the 4th century, when it was a Persian citadel. Most of the walls were built in the 8th century by the Arab emirs, whose palace was inside the fortress. Subsequently Georgians, Turks and Persians captured and patched up Narikala, but in 1827 a huge explosion of Russian munitions stored here wrecked the whole thing, and today it's a rather picturesque ruin, with only its walls largely intact.
    </p>
    <p>The Church of St Nicholas, inside the fortress, was rebuilt in the 1990s. The choice way to reach Narikala is by cable car from Rike Park. Or you can walk up from Meidan or via the Betlemi St Stairs, which lead off Lado Asatiani qucha in Sololaki. The views over Tbilisi from the top of the fortress are superb.
    </p>
    <h2 id="abanotubani">Abanotubani</h2>
    <img src="https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/39ed533e7b6ccb4bedcaabdfd9e0e736-abanotubani.jpg?auto=compress&crop=center&fit=crop&format=auto&h=416&w=960">
    <p>The brick domes rising here are the roofs of subterranean bathhouses, the Abanotubani. Alexanders Dumas and Pushkin both bathed in these sulphurous waters, the latter describing it as the best bath he’d ever had. Outwardly more impressive than the others, the above-ground Chreli Abano thermal baths have a Central Asian feel to their blue-tile facade.
    </p>
    <h2 id="sameba">Tsminda Sameba Cathedral</h2>
    <img src="http://ongo.ge/img/multimedia/a29368_35085_1617540141532252b.jpg">
    <p>The biggest symbol of the Georgian Orthodox Church's post-Soviet revival towers on Elia Hill above Avlabari. Tsminda Sameba, unmissable by night and day, was consecrated in 2004 after a decade of building. A massive and lavish expression of traditional Georgian architectural forms in concrete, brick, granite and marble, it rises a staggering 84m to the top of the gold-covered cross above its gold-covered central dome. While largely bare inside, it does, however, contain many of Georgia's most important icons.
    </p>
    <p>The cathedral is five aisles wide, but its emphasis is on verticality, with a result like one single, many-bulwarked tower. The huge dome creates a larger, much brighter central space than you’ll find in most Georgian churches. Designed by Archil Mindiashvili, the building was paid for mostly by donations. Some controversy surrounded its construction on the site of an old Armenian cemetery.
    </p>
    <h2 id="openair">Open-Air Museum of Ethnography</h2>
    <img src="https://sakurageorgia.com/storage/app/uploads/public/5d2/b3b/67b/5d2b3b67ba637684126256.jpg">
    <p>This collection of traditional, mostly wooden houses, from all around Georgia, is spread over a wooded hillside with good views, and makes for an enjoyable visit. The most interesting exhibits are in the lower section (near the entrance), where the buildings are kitted out with traditional furnishings, rugs and utensils, and the attendants can often explain things in English.
    </p>
    <p>You can walk up to the museum through large, verdant Vake Park (reachable by bus 61 from Freedom Sq or northbound on Rustaveli), or stay on the bus until the petrol station 200m past the large Iranian embassy, then walk or take a taxi 1.4km up the road opposite.
    </p>
    <h2 id="metekhi">Metekhi Church</h2>
    <img src="https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0b/39/98/15.jpg">
    <p>The landmark Metekhi Church, and the 1960s equestrian statue of King Vakhtang Gorgasali beside it, occupy the strategic rocky outcrop above the Metekhi Bridge. This is where Vakhtang Gorgasali built his palace, and the site’s first church, when he made Tbilisi his capital in the 5th century. The existing church was built by King Demetre Tavdadebuli (the Self-Sacrificing) between 1278 and 1289, and has been reconstructed many times since.
    </p>
    <p>The building is thought to be a copy of King David the Builder's 12th-century church on this site, which was destroyed by the Mongols in 1235.
    </p>
    <h2 id="funicular">Funicular</h2>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dc/94/ef/dc94ef6de8f7a324986f15e6dfcd9092.jpg">
    <p>The ride up Mt Mtatsminda on the city's funicular is spectacular, as are the views from the top – and there are a couple of great places to eat or drink, as well as dozens of funfair rides too. It's also several degrees cooler up here than in the city below, which can be very welcome in the heat of summer.
    </p>
    <p>To ride the funicular you need a 2 GEL plastic card (sold at the ticket office) on which you then add credit for your rides (and any rides in Mtatsminda Park).
